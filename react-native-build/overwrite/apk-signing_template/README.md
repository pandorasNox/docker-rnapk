this is only an example/template folder

you have to:

1) generate key + keystore
@see https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html#generating-a-signing-key

2) setting up the gradle.properties file
@see https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/signed-apk-android.html#setting-up-gradle-variables

putting these two files in an seperate folder, like here, and mount this folder to the docker build container
